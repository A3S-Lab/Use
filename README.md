## Overview

**A3S Use** is the application-capability layer for A3S. Browser and Office are
first-party domains in the default distribution. Independently distributed
packages can add more domains without rebuilding Use by declaring native CLI,
standard MCP, and/or `SKILL.md` surfaces in an A3S ACL manifest.

The primary user entry point is `a3s use`; `a3s-use` is the standalone binary
used by the umbrella CLI and remains available for direct use, automation, and
diagnostics. A3S Search does not call either CLI: it depends directly on the
small `a3s-use-browser` Rust crate and injects `Arc<dyn PageRenderer>`.

Use is not a workflow engine, a universal operating-system package manager, or
a new RPC protocol. It owns typed capability contracts and the lifecycle of
its managed providers and extension packages. The umbrella A3S CLI owns the
top-level component catalog, release sources, and product installation policy.

`a3s-use ...`.

## Features

- **Built-In Browser and Office**: Keep stable first-party command routes while
  reporting provider readiness separately
- **Typed Rust Contracts**: Embed Browser rendering and Office operations
  without starting a CLI process or an MCP server
- **Agent Browser Compatibility**: Provide the locked 82-command vocabulary,
  151 MCP tools, six packaged Skills, Dashboard, and interactive runtime from
  `agent-browser` 0.32.1
- **A3S-Native Office Foundation**: Own safe OOXML package, XML, relationship,
  selector, semantic read, transactional add/set/remove/move/copy/swap,
  scoped cross-format literal/regex replacement, typed text formatting,
  Spreadsheet number/fill/border/alignment formatting, exact merged-cell
  editing, stable multi-key physical row sorting with persisted sort state,
  typed worksheet and table AutoFilters, typed data validation and conditional
  formatting, scoped defined names, native Spreadsheet ListObject table
  lifecycle, inert hyperlinks, and
  legacy comments,
  native PNG/JPEG/GIF embedding, cross-format template merge, deterministic
  bounded all-format annotated views, all-format HTML/SVG semantic previews,
  bounded typed issue diagnostics, Browser-injected semantic PNG screenshots,
  authenticated loopback live watch, and an explicit typed standard MCP
  preview while retaining the 0.1.x
  OfficeCLI compatibility backend for surfaces not yet promoted
- **Packaged Office Guidance**: Ship one first-party `a3s-use-office` Skill for
  safe Word, Spreadsheet, Presentation, native MCP, and compatibility workflows
- **External Domains**: Install process-isolated packages that expose any useful
  combination of CLI, MCP, and Skill surfaces
- **Hot-Plug Discovery**: Publish immutable generation/revision snapshots so a
  resident host can add, replace, or remove live capabilities without restarting
- **Content-Bound Skills**: Project an absolute package path and lowercase
  SHA-256 for every `SKILL.md`, allowing consumers to verify the exact bytes
  before loading them
- **Managed Provider Safety**: Require explicit installation authority, bounded
  downloads, approved HTTPS origins, receipts, staging, and atomic activation
- **Structured Automation**: Return versioned `--json` documents and typed error
  codes while retaining native process status and streams for delegated commands
- **Component Ownership**: Remove only A3S-managed provider or package files;
  system browsers, user documents, profiles, and externally owned tools remain
  outside normal uninstall

### Capability matrix

| Domain | Origin | CLI | MCP | Skill | Runtime owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Browser | Built in | Full Browser vocabulary | A3S Use standard MCP server | Six packaged Browser Skills | A3S Use |
| Office | Built in | Stable Office vocabulary | Typed native preview plus OfficeCLI compatibility server | Packaged `a3s-use-office` Skill | A3S Use native engine; OfficeCLI compatibility in 0.1.x |
| Box | Reserved built-in route | Native A3S Box vocabulary | — | — | Umbrella A3S CLI |
| External domain | Installed extension | Optional native executable | Optional standard MCP server | Optional `SKILL.md` | Extension package plus A3S Use lifecycle |

The Box route is component-backed. The umbrella CLI resolves its authoritative
Box executable and passes the canonical path to Use for one invocation. Use
does not copy Box, discover a replacement on `PATH`, or write a second receipt.

### Cargo feature matrix

Default features are `browser`, `office`, `extensions`, and `mcp`.

| Feature | Included capability |
| --- | --- |
| `browser` | Typed Browser library, stateless rendering, and full Browser driver delegation |
| `office` | Typed Office contracts, native OOXML read engine, and temporary OfficeCLI compatibility |
| `extensions` | ACL manifests, package receipts, hot-plug registry, and external CLI/MCP/Skill routes |
| `mcp` | Standard MCP servers plus the managed Browser Streamable HTTP lifecycle |
| `lightpanda` | Explicit opt-in Lightpanda provider support in addition to Chrome |

A compiled command surface is not proof that its provider is installed. Use
`doctor`, `component status`, or `capabilities` to inspect runtime readiness.

### Crates

| Crate | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `a3s-use-core` | Shared diagnostics, errors, artifacts, session IDs, and risk classes |
| `a3s-use-browser` | Object-safe rendering contract, providers, managed runtimes, and sessions |
| `a3s-use-browser-driver` | Complete interactive Browser CLI, MCP tools, Skills, Dashboard, and compatibility runtime |
| `a3s-use-office` | Native OOXML foundation, typed Office operations, and compatibility lifecycle |
| `a3s-use-extension` | A3S ACL manifest model, package registry, leases, and native surface descriptors |
| `a3s-use` | Facade library, standalone CLI host, capability projection, and MCP entry points |

## Quick Start

### Installation

The preferred product installation goes through the umbrella CLI, which owns
release selection and the top-level component receipt:

```bash
a3s install use --source release
a3s install use/browser
a3s install use/office
a3s use doctor --json
```

Prebuilt archives are also published on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/A3S-Lab/Use/releases). A complete archive
contains `a3s-use`, its sibling `a3s-use-browser-driver`, Browser Skills, the
first-party Office Skill, the Dashboard, and license/provenance notices. Keep
those packaged assets together; installing only the facade binary does not
provide the complete Browser and Office Skill surfaces.

Build all binaries from source with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A3S-Lab/Use.git
cd Use
cargo build --workspace --bins --locked
./target/debug/a3s-use doctor --json
```

### Embed Browser rendering

Applications that only need page rendering should depend on the Browser crate,
not the facade binary:

```toml
[dependencies]
a3s-use-browser = "0.1.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
url = "2"
```

```rust,no_run
use std::sync::Arc;

use a3s_use_browser::{BrowserPool, BrowserPoolConfig, PageRenderer, RenderRequest};
use url::Url;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let browser = Arc::new(BrowserPool::new(BrowserPoolConfig::default()));
    let page = browser
        .render(RenderRequest::new(Url::parse("https://example.com")?))
        .await?;

    println!("{}", page.html);
    browser.shutdown().await;
    Ok(())
}
```

`BrowserPoolConfig::default()` discovers an existing Chrome-compatible browser
and never authorizes a download. Select a managed provider or run an explicit
component install when A3S should own the runtime.

## Browser

Browser has two deliberately separate integration levels:

- `a3s-use-browser` is the small typed library used by Search and embedded Rust
  applications. `browser render` also uses this direct in-process path.
- `a3s-use-browser-driver` provides the complete interactive automation surface
  and is shipped as a sibling executable in release archives.

The compatibility driver tracks
[vercel-labs/agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser)
`0.32.1` at commit
`2b202640ee89dc7aadb5e8c9d600e089e9056985`. Automated parity gates pin 82
accepted top-level commands, 151 typed MCP tools, and the `core`, `electron`,
`slack`, `dogfood`, `vercel-sandbox`, and `agentcore` Skills. Existing MCP
clients retain the `agent_browser_*` tool names.

With `--allowed-domains`, locally launched Chromium applies network controls
before paused pages, popups, workers, and out-of-process iframes resume. It
also blocks peer-connection constructors and non-proxied WebRTC UDP. Modes
that cannot guarantee early containment—including existing CDP sessions,
auto-connect, profiles, restore/state replay, direct-page providers, unsafe
startup arguments, iOS, and Safari—are rejected explicitly. Standalone
`wait --load load` and `wait --load domcontentloaded` also resolve immediately
when the active document has already reached the requested state.

`a3s-use mcp serve browser` exposes the A3S-owned standard MCP server over
stdio. `mcp start`, `mcp status`, and `mcp stop` manage its optional persistent
Streamable HTTP deployment. That deployment binds to an ephemeral loopback
port, requires a private bearer token, has bounded idle and maximum lifetimes,
and shares typed Browser session state. It is an MCP deployment, not an A3S
JSON-RPC service.

Provider selection stays explicit. Discovered providers never download
software. Managed Chrome and Lightpanda installations use bounded staging and
atomic activation; Lightpanda assets require the publisher SHA-256. Chrome for
Testing does not publish an independent checksum in its current version feed,
so A3S records HTTPS provenance and the locally observed digest without claiming
publisher verification.

See [Agent Browser Compatibility Baseline](docs/agent-browser-parity.md) for the
locked schemas, digests, runtime evidence, and promotion criteria.

## Office

Office is moving to an A3S-owned Rust engine for Word, Spreadsheet, and
Presentation documents. The native engine now includes bounded package
admission, byte-preserving XML, content types, a safe relationship graph,
stable selectors, semantic `get`, `query`, `text`, `outline`, and `stats`
reads, bounded `issues` reports, safe blank-document creation, and
loss-preserving text assignment plus scoped literal/regex replacement for Word,
Spreadsheet, and Presentation. Matches may span rich-text runs without
flattening their formatting. Typed rich-text mutation covers bold, italic,
`none`/single/double underline, baseline/superscript/subscript, font family,
exact centipoint font size, RGB text color, and horizontal alignment. Word and
Spreadsheet also support an explicit single-strikethrough boolean;
Presentation rejects that property with a typed error instead of silently
dropping it. Word and Presentation additionally share a portable 17-color
highlight palette, display-only text case, and conservative BCP-47 primary
language tags. Word alone supports explicit double strikethrough; Spreadsheet
and Presentation reject it through format-specific typed errors.
Word and Presentation apply character properties to run paths and alignment to
paragraph paths; Spreadsheet applies the same contract to cells or bounded A1
ranges,
creating and deduplicating OOXML font and cell-style records when necessary. It
also exposes a separate typed Spreadsheet cell-presentation contract for
number formats, solid RGB fill or explicit fill removal, cardinal and diagonal
borders, vertical alignment, wrap text, rotation, indentation, shrink-to-fit,
and reading order. These properties apply to a cell or bounded rectangular
range, compose atomically with content and text formatting, preserve unknown
style data, and deduplicate number-format, fill, border, and cell-style
records. Spreadsheet merged cells use a separate typed contract: rectangular
A1 ranges are normalized, exact repeated merges are idempotent, and unmerge
requires one exact existing range. Geometric overlaps and ListObject table
intersections fail closed. Semantic reads expose stable `mergeCell` nodes and
anchor metadata without materializing every blank covered cell. A third typed
Spreadsheet contract owns data-validation rules for list, whole-number,
decimal, date, time, text-length, and custom-formula constraints. One rule may
target multiple disjoint normalized A1 ranges and carries typed comparison
operators, prompt/error messages, alert style, blank handling, and
list-dropdown state. Inline lists are quoted safely, ISO dates and clock times
are normalized to Spreadsheet serial values, and overlapping rule ranges fail
atomically. Semantic reads expose stable `/Sheet/dataValidation[N]` nodes,
annotate observed and virtual blank cells, and project inert metadata into
HTML/SVG. Native add/set/remove, batch, exact replay, CLI, Rust, and standard
MCP use the same closed contract while retaining strict/transitional
SpreadsheetML and unknown attributes. It stores validation formulas but does
not evaluate them.

A separate typed Spreadsheet conditional-format contract owns comparison and
formula rules; text, rank, average, duplicate/unique, blank/error, and time
predicates; data bars; two- or three-color scales; and standard three-, four-,
or five-icon sets. Classic rules apply a differential solid fill, font color,
and bold state. Visual rules use typed thresholds, colors, and display flags.
One rule can cover multiple disjoint A1 areas and can stop later rule
evaluation. Semantic reads expose stable `/Sheet/cf[N]` nodes and selectors
such as `conditionalFormatting[type=dataBar]`. Rust, versioned batch, CLI,
standard MCP, exact replay, and the Office Skill share the closed value. The
writer deduplicates differential formats, preserves strict or transitional
SpreadsheetML plus unknown attributes, and fails closed when unsupported child
or collection content would be lost. This milestone does not evaluate rule
formulas, reproduce Excel rendering, or cover x14-only data-bar axes/colors,
table/chart/pivot conditional formatting, or complete Spreadsheet parity.

Native Spreadsheet defined names use a separate typed contract for
workbook-global and worksheet-local scopes. Stable selectors include both name
and scope, while compatibility selectors remain available when the name is
unambiguous. `worksheet:workbook` disambiguates a local scope when the
worksheet itself is literally named `workbook`. The writer validates Excel identifier and reference limits,
qualifies a bare A1 range only for a local scope, enforces case-insensitive
uniqueness by `(name, scope)`, rejects ListObject table-name collisions, and
protects `_xlnm.*` and `Slicer_*` names owned by other Office features.
Semantic get/query, ordinary typed remove, batch, exact replay, CLI, Rust, and
standard MCP share the same value. Strict/transitional SpreadsheetML and
unknown defined-name attributes are retained; unknown collection or child
content fails closed when it cannot be preserved. This is defined-name
lifecycle support, not formula evaluation, external-link authoring, or complete
Spreadsheet parity.

Native Spreadsheet AutoFilters use a closed typed contract shared by worksheet
filters and ListObject tables. One value owns a normalized rectangular A1
range plus at most one criterion for each zero-based range column. Supported
criteria are exact value sets with optional blanks; equality, text, and ordered
comparisons; between/not-between; blanks/non-blanks; top/bottom count or
percentage; and closed dynamic average, relative-date, month, and quarter
families. Worksheet lifecycle uses stable `/Sheet/autofilter` and
`/Sheet/autofilter/filterColumn[N]` paths; table filters appear below
`/Sheet/table[N]/autofilter`. Rust, versioned batch, CLI, standard MCP, exact
replay, and the Office Skill use the same value. The strict/transitional writer
sorts columns deterministically, escapes wildcard literals, rejects duplicate
or out-of-range columns, protects table/merge geometry, and fails closed for
imported date-group items, color/icon filters, embedded sort state,
extensions, comments, or unknown attributes. Physical row sorting is owned by
the separate typed sort contract below; an imported AutoFilter with unsupported
embedded sort state remains readable but non-mutable.

Native Spreadsheet sorting physically reorders a worksheet range through one
stable, ordered multi-key contract. A worksheet path auto-detects its used
range; callers may instead supply `/Sheet/A1:D100`. Keys are absolute `A:XFD`
columns inside that range, the first selected row stays fixed only when
`header=true`, text comparison is case-insensitive by default, numbers sort
before text, blanks always remain last, and records equal on every key retain
their source order. Partial-column sorts move only selected cells; cells outside
the range and destination row properties stay fixed. The editor persists a
worksheet SpreadsheetML `sortState`, exposed as `/Sheet/sort` and ordered
`/Sheet/sort/key[N]` nodes. Removing `/Sheet/sort` deletes metadata only and
never reverses the physical row order.

Rust, versioned batch/replay, CLI, standard MCP, and the Office Skill share the
same sort value. Sorts accept 1–64 unique keys and at most 100,000 selected
cells. Exact mutable ListObject or worksheet-AutoFilter ranges, or their exact
data ranges, are supported. Table totals rows, formulas anywhere in the
workbook, intersecting merges, pivots, unknown existing sort state, and drawing
anchors that cannot follow one record losslessly fail closed. Hyperlinks,
comments/VML notes, data validation, conditional formatting, protected ranges,
ignored errors, and supported drawing anchors move with their records; chart
caches are cleared and the worksheet used dimension is recomputed after the
physical change.

Native Spreadsheet tables use a separate closed ListObject contract. Add and
set own the workbook-wide `name`, optional distinct `displayName`, final
rectangular A1 range, one exact column identity per range column, header/totals
row state, typed filter criteria, built-in light/medium/dark style identity,
and first/last-column plus row/column-stripe flags; ordinary typed `remove`
owns deletion. When a header is enabled, its names are stamped into the first
row and the table-owned AutoFilter range excludes an enabled totals row. The
editor rejects
Excel-identifier and A1/R1C1 name errors,
case-insensitive table/defined-name collisions, duplicate columns, missing data
rows, table/merge/worksheet-AutoFilter overlap, and unsafe relationship graphs.
Semantic reads expose stable `/Sheet/table[N]` and child column paths. Rust,
versioned batch, CLI, standard MCP, exact replay, and the Office Skill share the
same value while strict/transitional SpreadsheetML and supported unknown root
or style data are retained. Imported calculated columns, totals functions,
date-group/color/icon filters, unsupported embedded sort state, custom styles,
query tables, and external data remain explicit gaps and fail closed when a
lossless typed mutation cannot be proved. Exact mutable table and data ranges
can still be physically sorted through the separate sort contract.

The engine also creates, updates, reads,
queries, and removes typed hyperlinks. Word owns
external HTTP/HTTPS/mailto links and internal bookmark targets in body,
header, and footer paragraphs, with display text and tooltips; Spreadsheet
owns external links and internal workbook locations on cells or bounded
rectangular ranges, with display text and tooltips, auto-creating a missing
single linked cell; Presentation owns external shape-wide links and internal
jumps to existing slides, with optional tooltips. External targets reject
embedded credentials, active or relative schemes, and malformed URIs; semantic rendering
keeps every relationship inert and never fetches it. The same typed engine
creates, updates, reads, queries, and removes classic Office comments. Word
comments anchor to a main-document paragraph or run and expose stable
`/comments/comment[N]` paths. Spreadsheet comments are classic cell notes with
an author table, VML note drawing, and `/SheetName/A1/comment` paths, including
notes on otherwise blank cells. Presentation comments use legacy per-slide
comment and shared-author parts, optional EMU coordinates, and
`/slide[N]/comment[M]` paths. Removing an owning Word node, Spreadsheet cell or
range, or Presentation slide also removes its owned comment resources. This is
plain legacy-comment scope, not complete modern threaded-comment parity:
replies, resolved state, writable dates, rich bodies, Word header/footer
anchors, Spreadsheet threaded comments, and modern PowerPoint threaded
comments remain outside the typed contract. The engine can safely inspect
existing XML parts and replace non-OPC-metadata XML parts while preserving the
root QName and validating the final document. Known chart, header, and footer
part carriers can be created together with their content type and owner
relationship. The typed mutation layer also adds and removes Word paragraphs
and basic table/row/cell structures,
creates real Presentation DrawingML tables, appends grid-conformant rows,
fills underfull rows, edits cell text, and exposes table columns as stable
virtual paths. Columns can be inserted, resized in EMUs, removed, moved,
copied, or swapped while the grid, every row, and the graphic-frame width stay
in sync. Tables and structurally safe rows/cells can also be removed. It
upserts typed Spreadsheet text, number, boolean, and formula cells, removes
cells and bounded cell ranges, structurally inserts or deletes rows and columns,
and adds, removes, renames, reorders, or copies worksheets. It also exposes
typed `move`, `copy`, and `swap` mutations with zero-based or path-relative
placement. Word supports same-parent paragraph, table, row, cell, and run
moves and swaps plus identity-free paragraph, table, row, and run copies.
Spreadsheet supports worksheet arrangement and dense plain-row arrangement with
row/cell renumbering. Presentation supports slide arrangement, same-slide
top-level object movement/swaps, layout-only slide copies, and relationship-free
plain-shape copies with fresh non-visual identities. Cross-parent ownership
migration, formula-bearing or reference-rich row arrangement, identity-bearing
Word copies, table-cell copies, and relationship-owning Presentation copies fail
closed before save. Worksheet copy
clones the owned OPC relationship subgraph while preserving shared workbook
resources; removal garbage-collects only unshared descendants. Structural
Spreadsheet edits rewrite affected A1 formulas, defined names, worksheet
metadata, tables, comments, VML notes, drawing anchors, and chart references;
unsupported pivot and 3D-reference cases fail closed before save. Presentation
slides, text shapes, and basic tables also support native add/remove. PNG, JPEG,
and GIF can be embedded as real Word inline pictures, Spreadsheet one-cell
drawing anchors, and Presentation slide pictures; semantic reads and
reference-aware removal use the same cross-format `Picture` contract. Saves are
atomic and reject a changed source revision instead of overwriting another
writer.
Cross-format template merge replaces `{{key}}` text in Word document and
auxiliary text parts, Spreadsheet string cells, and Presentation slides and
notes while preserving split-run formatting and reporting unresolved keys.

The native document engine does not require Microsoft Office, LibreOffice,
OfficeCLI, Python, Node.js, or .NET. LibreOffice may be used only by optional
CI interoperability checks and is never part of document execution. Optional
PNG screenshot output requires the `browser` feature and a ready A3S Browser
provider because it captures the native semantic HTML through the existing
Browser contract.

The explicit `office native` CLI exposes in-process blank creation, reads,
typed add/set/remove/move/copy/swap, scoped literal/regex replacement,
rich-text, exact Spreadsheet merged-cell, stable Spreadsheet physical sorting
with persisted sort state, worksheet/table AutoFilter,
data-validation, conditional-format, defined-name, ListObject table, hyperlink,
and legacy-comment
operations, constrained raw XML access,
known typed part carriers, exact replay artifacts for a constrained canonical
subset, visible PNG/JPEG/GIF pictures, and atomic mutation batches, plus
dependency-free template merge and semantic rendering today. HTML and SVG are
available for Word, Spreadsheet, and Presentation; bounded annotated and issue
views are available for all three formats; and Browser-injected PNG screenshots
are available for all three formats. An authenticated, loopback-only foreground
watch provides full saved-revision refresh for all three formats without a
resident pipe or mutation endpoint. `mcp serve office-native` exposes the same
editor, annotated/issue analysis, and screenshot composition through typed
standard MCP tools and bounded in-memory sessions.
The packaged `a3s-use-office` Skill exposes the same product boundaries to
agents without starting OfficeCLI. Discover its metadata with
`office skills list`, read only its `SKILL.md` with
`office skills get a3s-use-office`, append its four format/MCP references with
`--full`, or locate the installed directory with `office skills path`. The
capability snapshot binds the Skill path and lowercase SHA-256 so a resident
host can verify the bytes before loading them.
Other `0.1.x` commands and the default `mcp serve office` target still use a
compatibility backend pinned to OfficeCLI `1.0.136`. This is a migration
boundary, not a native-promotion claim. The default routes will be promoted
only after mutation, fidelity, rendering, compatibility, and cross-application
interoperability gates pass.

```

The native MCP process exposes 12 typed tools: `office_validate`,
`office_create`, `office_open`, `office_list`, `office_get`, `office_query`,
`office_view`, `office_raw_xml`, `office_apply_batch`,
`office_merge_template`, `office_save`, and `office_close`. It accepts no shell
command string and defines no A3S RPC dialect; stdio carries only standard MCP.
Each process owns at most 64 sessions. Mutation batches are atomic in memory,
limited to 10,000 mutations and 8 MiB of JSON, and remain unsaved until
`office_save`. Results are limited to 8 MiB, raw XML responses to 1 MiB, and
queries to at most 1,000 returned nodes. `office_close` rejects dirty sessions
unless the caller saves or explicitly sets `discard=true`. `office_view`
accepts `html` and `svg` for all three formats in addition to text, annotated,
outline, and statistics. The typed `annotated` view flattens stable semantic
paths, node types, text, styles, and observed formatting; its `limit` is 1
through 1,000 and defaults to 200. The `issues` view accepts an optional typed
`issueType` and a `limit` from 1 through 1,000, defaulting to 200. It also
accepts `screenshot` for all three formats; that mode requires a no-clobber
local `output` ending in `.png` and accepts an optional `timeoutMs` from 1
through 120,000.

Native issue analysis is conservative and read-only. It currently reports
missing picture alternative text, missing or incompatible internal part
relationships, formulas without cached results, formulas that reference a
missing worksheet, cached or explicit formula errors, and low contrast between
explicit RGB run text and its own shape fill. Reports include stable category,
subtype, severity, path, context, and suggestion fields; filtering happens
before the bounded result window, and `count`, `returned`, and `truncated`
remain explicit. It does not infer text overflow, object overlap, theme or
inherited colors, or Microsoft Office layout behavior. A clean report is not a
full fidelity or interoperability certification.

Native render artifacts are deterministic, standalone, and network-free. They
contain no timestamp or source path, escape document text and attributes, carry
stable semantic paths as `data-path`, and embed only validated internal
PNG/JPEG/GIF parts as `data:` URLs. HTML declares a restrictive CSP and uses a
sparse observed-cell representation instead of expanding large Spreadsheet
gaps. Each render is bounded to 16 MiB while it is composed. CLI `--output`
publishes through an atomic no-clobber file operation; inline MCP output remains
subject to the stricter 8 MiB structured-result limit. These are semantic
previews, not a Microsoft Office layout-fidelity claim. Screenshot mode stages
the same deterministic HTML privately, opens its `file://` URL through the
existing `PageRenderer`, and validates one regular PNG plus its size and
SHA-256 receipt before atomic no-clobber publication. It defaults to a 30-second
deadline, caps the deadline at 120 seconds, and caps the PNG at 64 MiB. It does
not fetch external relationships or consult OfficeCLI.

`office native watch <file>` renders the same bounded all-format HTML, binds
only `127.0.0.1`, selects an ephemeral port by default, and prints a URL with a
fresh 256-bit capability token. Every page, status response, and standard SSE
stream requires that token or its HttpOnly same-site cookie and validates the
exact loopback `Host`. The wrapper runs its own fixed script while the document
preview stays in a sandboxed iframe under the renderer's script-free CSP.
Atomic saves from another `office native` process trigger a full refresh.
Transient missing or invalid revisions leave the last valid preview visible,
publish a typed error state, and retry until recovery. The server is read-only:
it has no mutation/RPC endpoint, never opens an external relationship, and
does not observe unsaved `office-native` MCP sessions until `office_save`.
`--timeout-ms` bounds automated runs; otherwise Ctrl+C stops the foreground
server. Interactive editing, selection/mark overlays, and layout goldens remain
open.

Native batch input is an ordinary JSON document, not an RPC protocol. The
current schema is:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "mutations": [
    {
      "operation": "replace-text",
      "path": "/body",
      "replacement": {
        "find": "Q([1-4]) 2025",
        "replace": "Q$1 2026",
        "mode": "regex"
      }
    },
    {
      "operation": "set-text",
      "path": "/body/p[1]",
      "text": "Updated"
    },
    {
      "operation": "add-paragraph",
      "parent": "/body",
      "text": "Summary"
    },
    {
      "operation": "remove",
      "path": "/body/p[2]"
    },
    {
      "operation": "move",
      "path": "/body/p[3]",
      "position": {
        "kind": "before",
        "path": "/body/p[1]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The whole batch rolls back if any mutation fails. Inputs are limited to 8 MiB
and 10,000 mutations. The version 1 mutation set is `replace-text`, `set-text`,
`set-text-format`, `set-cell-format`, `add-data-validation`,
`set-data-validation`, `add-conditional-format`, `set-conditional-format`,
`add-named-range`, `set-named-range`, `add-spreadsheet-table`,
`set-spreadsheet-table`, `add-spreadsheet-auto-filter`,
`set-spreadsheet-auto-filter`, `sort-spreadsheet-range`, `merge-cells`,
`unmerge-cells`,
`set-hyperlink`, `set-comment`, `set-table-column-width`,
`set-cell-value`, `add-paragraph`,
`add-table`, `add-table-row`, `add-table-column`, `add-table-cell`,
`add-comment`, `add-worksheet`, `insert-rows`, `delete-rows`, `insert-columns`,
`delete-columns`, `rename-worksheet`, `move-worksheet`, `copy-worksheet`,
`move`, `copy`, `swap`, `replace-xml-part`, `add-part`, `add-slide`, `add-shape`,
`add-image`, and `remove`.

A data-validation mutation uses the same atomic document and standard MCP
payload. Remove a rule with the ordinary typed `remove` mutation:

```json
{
  "operation": "add-data-validation",
  "sheet": "/Sheet1",
  "validation": {
    "type": "whole",
    "ranges": ["B2:B50", "D2:D50"],
    "operator": "between",
    "formula1": "18",
    "formula2": "120",
    "allowBlank": false,
    "errorStyle": "warning"
  }
}
```

Each rule accepts 1–1,024 disjoint ranges and each worksheet accepts at most
65,534 rules. Formulas are limited to 255 characters; prompt/error titles to
32, prompts to 255, and error messages to 225. List and custom rules reject
operators and `formula2`; comparison rules require an operator and require
`formula2` only for `between` or `notBetween`. Invalid or overlapping input
rolls back the complete in-memory batch.

A conditional-format mutation uses one complete closed rule value. CLI `set`
can merge omitted options, while batch and standard MCP set replace the complete
value:

```json
{
  "operation": "add-conditional-format",
  "sheet": "/Sheet1",
  "conditionalFormat": {
    "ranges": ["A2:A20"],
    "stopIfTrue": true,
    "rule": {
      "type": "cellIs",
      "operator": "greaterThan",
      "formula1": "80",
      "format": {
        "fill": {"red": 198, "green": 239, "blue": 206},
        "bold": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Closed classic predicates plus data bars, two/three-color scales, and standard
3/4/5-icon sets are supported. Threshold, range, priority, shared-range, and
loss-preservation failures roll back the whole batch. Rule formulas are stored,
not evaluated, and the semantic preview is not Excel rendering evidence.

A named-range mutation uses one complete scoped value. Deletion reuses the
ordinary typed `remove` mutation:

```json
{
  "operation": "add-named-range",
  "namedRange": {
    "name": "Revenue",
    "ref": "'Sheet1'!$A$2:$A$20",
    "scope": "workbook",
    "comment": "Workbook revenue",
    "volatile": false
  }
}
```

Use `set-named-range` with a stable `path` and a complete `namedRange` value.
Names are limited to 255 characters, refs to 8,192, comments to 255, and a
workbook to 65,536 defined names. Workbook-scoped bare A1 refs, leading `=`,
cross-workbook refs without external-link parts, reserved Office-managed names,
duplicate `(name, scope)` identities, and ListObject table-name collisions fail
atomically. Use the explicit scope `worksheet:workbook` for a local name on a
worksheet literally named `workbook`.

A worksheet AutoFilter mutation uses one complete range-and-columns value.
Table `filters` use the same column objects:

```json
{
  "operation": "add-spreadsheet-auto-filter",
  "sheet": "/Sheet1",
  "filter": {
    "range": "A1:C20",
    "columns": [
      {
        "column": 0,
        "criteria": {
          "type": "values",
          "values": ["Open", "Closed"],
          "includeBlanks": true
        }
      },
      {
        "column": 2,
        "criteria": {"type": "between", "lower": "10", "upper": "100"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Use `set-spreadsheet-auto-filter` with `/Sheet/autofilter` and a complete
`filter`; ordinary typed `remove` deletes it. CLI `set` preserves an omitted
range, replaces all criteria when one or more `--filter` objects are supplied,
and uses `--clear-filters` for an explicit empty criterion list. Column offsets
are zero-based and unique inside the range. Imported date-group/color/icon
filters, embedded sort state, extensions, and unknown content are readable but
`nativeMutable=false`. Use the separate physical sort mutation for supported
ranges; it does not flatten an unsupported imported AutoFilter.

A Spreadsheet physical sort mutation owns an ordered, stable multi-key value:

```json
{
  "operation": "sort-spreadsheet-range",
  "path": "/Sheet1/A1:D100",
  "sort": {
    "keys": [
      {"column": "B", "direction": "descending"},
      {"column": "C", "direction": "ascending"}
    ],
    "header": true,
    "caseSensitive": false
  }
}
```

The path may instead be `/Sheet1` to auto-detect the used range. Keys are
unique absolute `A:XFD` columns within that range; 1–64 keys and at most
100,000 selected cells are accepted. Numbers precede text, blanks remain last
in both directions, and rows equal across every key retain source order. A
partial-column range moves only its cells, preserving cells outside the range
and destination row properties. Exact mutable table and worksheet-AutoFilter
ranges, or their exact data ranges, are supported. Formulas, totals rows,
intersecting merges, pivots, unknown sort state, and non-lossless drawing
movement fail the whole batch before save.

Read persisted metadata at `/Sheet1/sort` and ordered
`/Sheet1/sort/key[N]`. An ordinary `remove` of `/Sheet1/sort` removes only the
SpreadsheetML sort state; it does not restore the prior physical row order.
Supported record-bound hyperlinks, comments/VML notes, validations,
conditional formatting, protected ranges, ignored errors, and drawing anchors
follow the row permutation. The worksheet used dimension is recomputed and
chart caches are cleared. Exact replay emits the same
`sort-spreadsheet-range` mutation.

A Spreadsheet table mutation uses one complete ListObject value. CLI `set`
preserves omitted fields; batch, Rust, and standard MCP replacements supply the
complete table:

```json
{
  "operation": "add-spreadsheet-table",
  "sheet": "/Sheet1",
  "table": {
    "name": "Sales",
    "range": "A1:C4",
    "columns": [
      {"name": "Name"},
      {"name": "Qty"},
      {"name": "Price"}
    ],
    "filters": [
      {"column": 1, "criteria": {"type": "top", "count": 10}}
    ],
    "headerRow": true,
    "totalsRow": false,
    "style": {"family": "medium", "number": 4},
    "showFirstColumn": false,
    "showLastColumn": false,
    "showRowStripes": true,
    "showColumnStripes": false
  }
}
```

Use `set-spreadsheet-table` with a stable `path` and complete `table`; use
ordinary typed `remove` for deletion. Styles are `none`, light 1–21, medium
1–28, or dark 1–11. `none` requires all style flags to be false. The final range
must leave at least one data row after enabled header and totals rows and must
not intersect another table, a merge, or a worksheet-level AutoFilter. Table
filters require an enabled header; `--clear-filters` clears their criteria
without removing the table-owned AutoFilter range.

An image mutation uses the same versioned batch boundary:

```json
{
  "operation": "add-image",
  "parent": "/Sheet1/B2",
  "image": {
    "format": "png",
    "data": "<base64>",
    "name": "Logo",
    "altText": "A3S logo",
    "widthPx": 320
  }
}
```

The native engine validates decoded format signatures and structure, bounds
bytes and pixel dimensions, infers a missing axis from the source aspect ratio,
and inserts a visible OOXML picture object. Word uses an inline DrawingML run,
Spreadsheet uses a one-cell drawing anchor, and Presentation uses a slide
picture. Removal deletes the XML object and an unused image relationship, then
deletes the media part and content-type declaration only when no relationship
anywhere in the package still targets it. Direct CLI image inputs must be
regular, non-symlink files no larger than 64 MiB. Normal CLI output never
contains image data; `createdImage` and batch `createdImages` receipts contain
only paths, owner/media parts, relationship ID, format, and final dimensions.

OOXML SVG image embedding is not implemented yet; the all-format SVG semantic
preview is an output format and does not alter the package. Correct OOXML SVG
image support requires an SVG part plus a raster fallback rather than treating
SVG as an ordinary bitmap.

Image replacement, crop, rotation, effects, compression controls, floating
Word wrapping, Spreadsheet two-cell sizing, and rich layout rendering also
remain outside this bounded add/read/remove milestone.

`office native dump` produces a stricter versioned batch artifact, also as
ordinary JSON:

```json
{
  "format": "a3s.office.native-replay",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "documentKind": "word",
  "scope": "/",
  "base": "blank",
  "baseSha256": "<sha256-of-the-uncompressed-blank-part-map>",
  "resultSha256": "<sha256-of-the-uncompressed-result-part-map>",
  "mutations": []
}
```

The first dump scope is the complete document (`/`). It accepts only content
that current typed mutations can reproduce byte-for-byte at the OOXML part-map
level: plain Word paragraphs and rectangular tables, Spreadsheet worksheets,
typed defined names, typed cells, typed worksheet/table AutoFilters, typed
ListObject tables, stable physical row order with supported typed sort state,
merged ranges, typed data-validation rules, and canonical typed
conditional-format rules without cached formula results;
plus Presentation slides with plain one-run text shapes and canonical basic
tables.
Headers, notes,
media, custom or non-canonical table styling, rich text, non-canonical package resources,
and every other lossy case fail with
`use.office.dump_unsupported`; nothing is silently flattened or omitted.

Replay requires the exact A3S blank template identified by `baseSha256`.
`batch` checks that precondition before mutation and checks `resultSha256`
afterward. A failed result check restores the original in-memory package before
any save. Dump files are limited to 8 MiB and 10,000 mutations, refuse to
overwrite an existing path, and use a 1 MiB inline-output limit. This is a
portable Office batch artifact, not RPC and not a universal action envelope.

`office native merge` opens a `.docx`, `.xlsx`, or `.pptx` template, performs a
single-pass replacement, validates the resulting OPC/semantic document, and
atomically writes a separate output. The template and output may not identify
the same file. The output is no-clobber by default; `--force` is the only way to
replace an existing destination, and it never authorizes modifying the template
in place.

Merge data must be a JSON object. Literal top-level keys take precedence over
flattened nested paths: `{"user.name":"literal","user":{"name":"nested"}}`
resolves `{{user.name}}` to `literal`. Nested objects use dot paths and arrays
use bracket paths such as `{{items[0].name}}`. Replacement is deliberately
single pass, so a value containing `{{another.key}}` remains literal and is
reported as unresolved rather than recursively substituted. Results include the
replacement count, sorted used keys, sorted unresolved placeholders, and sorted
changed OOXML parts.

Word merge covers the main document, headers, footers, footnotes, endnotes, and
comments. Presentation merge covers slides and notes. Spreadsheet merge covers
inline strings, direct `t="str"` values, and referenced shared rich strings;
shared-string replacements are counted per referencing cell and phonetic runs
are left untouched. A resolved placeholder in a numeric, boolean, error, or
otherwise unsupported cell fails closed instead of coercing the cell type.

Data files are limited to 8 MiB and must be regular, non-symlink files. Flattened
data is additionally bounded by entry count, nesting depth, key length, and
total bytes. XML-forbidden replacement characters fail the whole in-memory
transaction before any output is created. This native path does not invoke
OfficeCLI, Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, Python, Node.js, or .NET.

General text replacement is separate from template merge. `replace-text` uses
an explicit semantic path and either case-sensitive, non-overlapping literal
matching or a linear-time Rust regular expression. Word `/` covers the main
document plus headers, footers, footnotes, endnotes, and comments; narrower
body, header/footer, paragraph, run, table, cell, hyperlink, and comment paths
stay within their source part. Spreadsheet accepts `/`, a worksheet, or one
cell/rectangular range and edits only string cells. A scoped shared-string edit
clones the rich shared-string item and redirects selected cells when other
cells still reference the original. Presentation accepts `/`,
slide/object/text paths, and `/slide[N]/notes`; slide scopes do not implicitly
include notes. Phonetic Spreadsheet text is never changed.

One operation accepts at most 64 KiB of find expression, 1 MiB of replacement
text, 100,000 semantic matches, 64 MiB of expanded replacement text, and a
100,000-cell Spreadsheet scope. Regex matches must consume text. Results report
`matchCount`, `changed`, and sorted `changedParts`; zero matches are a
successful unchanged result. Batch results add these receipts under
`textReplacements`. All replacements are single pass, preserve split-run
ownership by assigning new text to the first matched run, retain unknown XML,
support strict and transitional OOXML, and participate in normal batch rollback
and post-mutation validation.

Raw replacement is also available inside the same atomic batch:

```json
{
  "operation": "replace-xml-part",
  "part": "/word/document.xml",
  "xml": "<w:document xmlns:w=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main\"><w:body><w:p/></w:body></w:document>"
}
```

Only existing XML parts may be replaced. `[Content_Types].xml`, root and
part-level relationship files, binary parts, DTDs, external entities, non-UTF-8
input, and replacement roots with a different local name or namespace are
rejected. Direct `raw-set` input is limited to 8 MiB. Inline `raw` output is
limited to 1 MiB; use its `--output` option to export larger original part bytes
without modifying the Office package. Raw export refuses to overwrite an
existing destination. Every replacement runs through the normal semantic and
OPC post-mutation validation, and any failure rolls back the whole batch.

Typed part creation is also batchable:

```json
{
  "operation": "add-part",
  "parent": "/slide[1]",
  "type": "chart"
}
```

The batch result keeps the existing ordered `paths` ledger, adds `swaps`
receipts containing the post-mutation `first` and `second` paths, and adds
`createdParts` receipts containing `part`, `ownerPart`, `relationshipId`, and
`type`. Text replacement receipts are reported separately under
`textReplacements` so a successful zero-match operation remains distinguishable
from a content change. Word supports chart, header, and footer carriers at `/`;
Spreadsheet supports chart carriers under a worksheet; Presentation supports
chart carriers under a slide. A carrier is a valid blank XML part with content
type and owner relationship. It is not visible in document layout until a typed
operation or explicit XML replacement references the returned relationship ID
from the owner XML.

Typed formatting is batchable through the same public mutation contract:

```json
{
  "operation": "set-text-format",
  "path": "/body/p[1]/r[1]",
  "format": {
    "bold": true,
    "underline": "double",
    "script": "superscript",
    "strikethrough": true,
    "doubleStrikethrough": false,
    "textCase": "small-caps",
    "highlight": "yellow",
    "language": "en-US",
    "fontFamily": "Aptos",
    "fontSizeCentipoints": 1150,
    "textColor": { "red": 0, "green": 102, "blue": 204 }
  }
}
```

`fontSizeCentipoints` is an integer count of 1/100 point; the CLI accepts the
equivalent point value through `--font-size`. `underline` accepts `none`,
`single`, or `double`, and `script` accepts `baseline`, `superscript`, or
`subscript`. `strikethrough` is supported by Word and Spreadsheet;
Presentation rejects it before mutation. `textCase`, `highlight`, and
`language` apply to Word and Presentation runs. `doubleStrikethrough` applies
only to Word. The portable highlight palette is `none`, the six bright colors,
black/white, and the dark or light gray/color variants exposed by the typed
schema. An empty `format` object, invalid BCP-47 shape, unknown properties,
invalid RGB components, and unsupported target/property combinations fail the
whole batch. Spreadsheet style records are cloned and deduplicated without
replacing unrelated style children or attributes.

Spreadsheet cell presentation uses its own typed mutation rather than adding
non-text properties to `set-text-format`:

```json
{
  "operation": "set-cell-format",
  "path": "/Sheet1/A1:C3",
  "format": {
    "numberFormat": "currency",
    "fill": {
      "kind": "solid",
      "color": { "red": 255, "green": 242, "blue": 204 }
    },
    "border": {
      "left": {
        "kind": "line",
        "style": "thin",
        "color": { "red": 128, "green": 128, "blue": 128 }
      },
      "right": { "kind": "line", "style": "thin" },
      "top": { "kind": "line", "style": "thin" },
      "bottom": { "kind": "line", "style": "double" },
      "diagonalUp": false,
      "diagonalDown": false
    },
    "verticalAlignment": "center",
    "wrapText": true,
    "textRotation": 0,
    "indent": 1,
    "shrinkToFit": false,
    "readingOrder": "left-to-right"
  }
}
```

`numberFormat` accepts an explicit Excel format code or `general`, `number`,
`currency`, `accounting`, `percent`, `scientific`, `text`, `date`, `time`, or
`datetime`. Format codes are limited to 255 characters, four sections, and
balanced quotes/brackets. Fill is either `none` or one solid 24-bit RGB color.
Each border side is an explicit `none` or `line` value. Lines accept `thin`,
`medium`, `thick`, `double`, `dashed`, `dotted`, `dashDot`, `dashDotDot`,
`hair`, `mediumDashed`, `mediumDashDot`, `mediumDashDotDot`, or
`slantDashDot`, plus an optional 24-bit RGB color. The shared diagonal line is
controlled independently from `diagonalUp` and `diagonalDown`. Vertical
alignment accepts `top`, `center`, `bottom`, `justify`, or
`distributed`; rotation accepts 0–180 or 255 for stacked text; indentation is
0–255; and reading order is `context`, `left-to-right`, or `right-to-left`.
Unknown fields, empty format objects, invalid values, and non-Spreadsheet
targets fail the whole batch. Native semantic HTML/SVG previews expose the
observed values as inert `data-*` attributes; they do not claim Excel layout
fidelity.

Spreadsheet merged cells are batchable through two closed mutations:

```json
{
  "operation": "merge-cells",
  "path": "/Sheet1/A1:C1"
}
```

Use `unmerge-cells` with the exact same path to remove the merge. Range order
and case are normalized. An exact repeated merge and an absent exact unmerge
are unchanged successes. A partial overlap, a range intersecting a Spreadsheet
table, or any unmerge range that intersects but does not exactly equal an
existing merge fails the complete batch. The latter error reports
`validRanges`; callers must unmerge each exact range rather than request a
destructive sweep. Strict and
transitional OOXML are retained, unknown `mergeCells` data is preserved, and
removing the final merge fails closed if deleting its container would discard
unknown attributes or children. Semantic cell reads expose `merge` and
`mergeAnchor`; range reads expose `merge=true|false`; and `mergeCell` queries
return stable nodes. HTML/SVG carry the same facts only as inert attributes.

Hyperlinks use the same typed batch contract and remain inert data:

```json
{
  "operation": "set-hyperlink",
  "path": "/body/p[1]",
  "hyperlink": {
    "target": {
      "kind": "external",
      "uri": "https://example.com/report"
    },
    "display": "Open report",
    "tooltip": "A3S report"
  }
}
```

Use `{ "kind": "internal", "location": "section_1" }` for a Word
bookmark, `Sheet1!B2` for a Spreadsheet location, or `/slide[2]` for a
Presentation slide jump. Word accepts body, header, and footer paragraph paths
when adding and the returned hyperlink path when updating. Spreadsheet accepts
one cell or a bounded rectangular range; only a missing single cell is created,
and a range link does not rewrite cell contents. Presentation accepts a shape
or its hyperlink path and does not accept separate display text. Removing a
hyperlink or its owning paragraph, cell/range, shape, or slide garbage-collects
only an unused hyperlink or slide relationship. Strict and transitional OOXML
namespaces are preserved.

Legacy comments use their own typed batch variants rather than generic
properties:

```json
{
  "operation": "add-comment",
  "parent": "/slide[1]",
  "comment": {
    "author": "Alice",
    "text": "Review this slide",
    "initials": "AL",
    "position": { "xEmu": 914400, "yEmu": 457200 }
  }
}
```

Use `set-comment` with a partial `update` object and the stable returned path.
Word accepts author, initials, and plain text on main-document comments;
Spreadsheet accepts author and plain text for classic cell notes; Presentation
also accepts a complete `position`. Removing a comment uses the ordinary typed
`remove` mutation. Unknown OOXML attributes and extension nodes survive these
updates, and strict/transitional relationship and root dialects are retained.
Modern threaded comments and replies, resolved state, writable comment dates,
rich comment bodies, Word header/footer anchors, and Spreadsheet threaded
comments are intentionally not represented yet.

Typed Spreadsheet content values use an explicit nested type, for example:

```json
{
  "operation": "set-cell-value",
  "path": "/Sheet1/C1",
  "value": {
    "type": "formula",
    "expression": "SUM(A1:B1)"
  }
}
```

Formula mutation stores OOXML formula text and marks the workbook for a full
recalculation when opened. Structural edits rewrite supported A1 references
without evaluating formulas. A complete formula parser, dependency graph, and
evaluator remain a separate rich-Spreadsheet delivery gate.

The native package, semantic, and editor APIs are available directly to Rust
callers:

Managed compatibility installation accepts only approved HTTPS release
origins, bounds the download, verifies the publisher SHA-256, stages outside
the active version, and activates atomically. Compatibility execution sets
`OFFICECLI_SKIP_UPDATE=1` so upgrades remain explicit A3S operations.

The native engine does not copy OfficeCLI's private resident protocol. The
explicit `office-native` target now provides typed in-process sessions over its
own standard MCP surface. Until the default-route promotion, a lost
compatibility response can return
`use.office.outcome_unknown`; callers must not retry it automatically.

See [Native Office Engine](docs/native-office.md) for the complete requirements,
compatibility scope, safety invariants, delivery gates, and migration plan.

## External Extensions

External Use domains stay behind process boundaries. A package contains an
`a3s-use-extension.acl` manifest parsed by `a3s-acl` and any declared native
executables or Skill files. ACL is the A3S Agent Configuration Language; it is
not HCL and is not parsed with an HCL parser.

```acl
extension "acme/slack" {
  schema_version = 1
  version        = "1.0.0"
  route          = "slack"
  actions        = ["read", "mutate"]

  cli {
    executable  = "bin/a3s-use-acme-slack"
    json_output = true
  }

  mcp {
    executable = "bin/a3s-use-acme-slack"
    args       = ["serve", "--mcp"]
    transport  = "stdio"
  }

  skill {
    path = "skills/slack/SKILL.md"
  }
}
```

Install an explicitly trusted local package and invoke its route with:

```bash
a3s install use/acme/slack --from ./slack-extension --allow-unsigned
a3s use slack channels list
a3s use mcp serve acme/slack

a3s use extension disable acme/slack --json
a3s use extension enable acme/slack --json
a3s uninstall use/acme/slack
```

The current extension source is an explicit local directory. It must pass
manifest, route, path, package-size, and executable validation, and unsigned
content requires `--allow-unsigned`. A signed remote publisher channel is
roadmap work; Use does not silently install arbitrary Homebrew, npm, Cargo,
system, or `PATH` packages.

Built-in and management routes are reserved. Extensions cannot shadow
`browser`, `office`, `box`, `component`, `capability`, or other host commands.

## Live Host Integration

Resident hosts consume `capability snapshot` and `capability watch`. The
projection presents Browser, Office, Box, and enabled extensions through one
read-only schema while preserving each binding's `built-in` or `extension`
origin. The extension generation advances on receipt mutations; a content
revision also changes when built-in readiness or packaged Skill content changes.

```bash
a3s-use capability snapshot --json
a3s-use capability watch \
  --after-generation 3 \
  --after-revision <sha256> \
  --timeout-ms 30000 \
  --json
```

A3S Code uses this contract to maintain a dedicated `use` worker for TUI and
Web sessions. The worker is default-deny and receives only `mcp__use_*` tools;
it cannot use the workspace, shell, unrelated MCP servers, or recursive task
tools. Projected Skills provide guidance only and cannot expand permissions or
authorize installation. Code verifies their projected SHA-256 before loading
the exact bytes.

A capability becomes callable only after its MCP connection is ready. A
removed or replaced route leaves the worker catalog before its old connection
drains. Starting Code never installs Use: component installation remains an
explicit umbrella CLI action.

## Protocol and Lifecycle Boundaries

Use preserves each native integration contract:

| Surface | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| CLI | `argv`, stdin, stdout, stderr, process status, and optional versioned `--json` output |
| MCP | Standard MCP client/server lifecycle and the package's declared transport |
| Skill | Existing `SKILL.md` package convention with a content digest in registry projections |

`--json` is structured CLI output, not JSON-RPC. Use does not define a generic
`execute(domain, action, payload)` envelope, translate one MCP vocabulary into
another, load Rust dynamic libraries, or aggregate every domain into one server.

Extension install and upgrade stage a unique immutable package directory, then
commit a receipt and atomically publish a new registry snapshot. Accepted CLI
or MCP invocations hold a shared route lease until their child process exits.
Disable and uninstall first hide the route from new callers, then wait for an
exclusive drain lease before deleting owned files. A drain timeout leaves the
route disabled, so retrying the lifecycle operation converges safely.

The receipt is authoritative. Reconciliation rebuilds a snapshot missed by a
crash, and in-flight calls retain the exact package generation they accepted.

```

The dependency arrows are intentional. Search links only the Browser contract,
so rendering does not require `a3s-use`, MCP, or a resident process. Office is
an in-process typed engine with a temporary 0.1.x compatibility process;
external domains retain their process boundaries. A3S Code consumes the
read-only projection and connects standard MCP/Skill surfaces; it does not gain
component installation authority.

Source is split between the facade under `src/` and focused workspace crates
under `crates/`. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for package leases,
registry publication, persistent sessions, component ownership, and roadmap
details.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Current guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS arm64 / x86_64 | Supported | Managed providers, extension lifecycle, complete Browser compatibility gates, and release archives |
| Linux arm64 / x86_64 | Supported | Managed providers, extension lifecycle, complete Browser compatibility gates, and release archives |
| WSL | Supported through Linux | Follows the Linux runtime and filesystem contract |
| Windows x86_64 | Preview / roadmap | Compile, command, MCP schema, Skill, packaging, and non-Browser-runtime checks only |

Windows is not currently part of the Browser runtime compatibility claim. It
will be promoted after real-Chrome sessions persist across separate
`a3s use browser` invocations with the same bounded startup, cleanup, and
lifecycle guarantees as macOS and Linux.

## Development

Run checks from the A3S Use repository directory:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --all-features --no-deps
```

The suite covers typed contracts, provider discovery and installation,
extension validation and route draining, capability snapshots, the native
OOXML package kernel, compatibility delegation, MCP schemas, packaged Skills,
and the locked agent-browser compatibility surface. Real-Chrome integration
gates run serially with isolated home and runtime directories on supported
platforms.
